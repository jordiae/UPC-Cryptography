ERROR:  The Sage installation tree has moved

from /home/jordiae/Downloads/SageMath
  to /home/jordiae/Development/SageMath

This is not supported, and Sage will not work. To install Sage from a
binary package:

1. Open the .tar.bz2 archive (or .dmg on OSX)

2. Move the SageMath folder/app to where you want it to be. You can
   also rename the directory now.

3. Start sage for the first time. This will then automatically patch
   paths in binaries.

After starting Sage for the first time you cannot change the
installation any more. To install Sage elsewhere, start over from the
binary package. Or recompile Sage from scratch in the new location
("make distclean && make")
